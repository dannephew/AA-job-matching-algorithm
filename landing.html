    <p>
        You've probably walked around your own neighborhood and seen Now Hiring signs, or worse Going out of business signs lining the streets. We learned that The Great Resignation and shifts to a gig economy not only affect large corporations with big HR departments, but also our local business owners who often serve as their own business' HR department. 

        Founded by MBA students at Northwestern Kellogg, Reinforcements is on a mission to connect busy, time-strapped business owners with individuals in their community who may be looking to work a couple hours a week, whenever businesses need more staff reinforcement. We're creating a two-sided platform that connects college students and retirees with local business owners- allowing each party to experience unparalleled flexibility and engagement. 
        
        Our Reinforcements team currently serves as the hiring concierge for busy, time-strapped business owners. We're launching in May and excited to bring on more local businesses and continue to grow our Reinforcements workforce.
