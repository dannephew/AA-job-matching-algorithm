        You've probably walked around your own neighborhood and seen Now Hiring signs, or worse Going out of business signs lining the streets. We learned that The Great Resignation and shifts to a gig economy not only affect large corporations with big HR departments, but also our local business owners who often serve as their own business' HR department. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded by MBA students at Northwestern Kellogg, Reinforcements is on a mission to connect busy, time-strapped business owners with individuals in their community who may be looking to work a couple hours a week, whenever businesses need more staff reinforcement. We're creating a two-sided platform that connects college students and retirees with local business owners- allowing each party to experience unparalleled flexibility and engagement. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Reinforcements team currently serves as the hiring concierge for busy, time-strapped business owners. We're launching in May and excited to bring on more local businesses and continue to grow our Reinforcements workforce.
